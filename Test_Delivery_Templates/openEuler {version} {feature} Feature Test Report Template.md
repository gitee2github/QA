# 3. Test Conclusion

## 3.1 Overall Test Conclusion

Describe the test conclusion in one or more sentences. For example: 
> For the XX feature, XX cases are executed, covering XX test and XX test. After the fuzzing and 24/7 long-term stability test, all issues are resolved, the regression test is passed with no known risk, and the overall quality is good. 
You can also describe the test conclusion using a table.

| Test | Result|
| -------- | -------- |
| API test|          |
| Function test|          |
| Special test|          |
